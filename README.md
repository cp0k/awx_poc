# Ansible Project Repository

This repository contains Ansible playbooks, roles, and configurations used to manage and automate our infrastructure.

## Repository Structure

- **`roles/`**: Contains individual roles. Each role is generated using `ansible-galaxy init` and includes tasks, handlers, variables, templates, and files specific to the role.
- **`inventories/`**: Contains environment-specific inventory files for `production` and `staging`.
  - `production`: Inventory files and variables for the production environment.
  - `staging`: Inventory files and variables for the staging environment.
- **`playbooks/`**: Stores Ansible playbooks.
- **`group_vars/` and `host_vars/`**: Contains variables that apply to groups of hosts or individual hosts.
- **`ansible.cfg`**: Configuration file for Ansible settings (e.g., inventory path, SSH settings).
- **`requirements.yml`**: Specifies external roles and collections needed for this project.
